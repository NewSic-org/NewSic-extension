## Overview

**NewSic** is a browser extension that transforms any news article into a Bollywood/Indian song. The title of the article is replaced with the name of a fictional Bollywood movie based on the content of the article.

## Features

- Convert news articles into Bollywood songs.
- Replace article titles with fictional Bollywood movie names.
- Add a touch of entertainment to your news reading experience.

## How it Works

The extension utilizes powerful language models, specifically a fine-tuned version of OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo, to generate Bollywood-style song lyrics and movie titles based on the content of news articles.

### Backend

- The backend of NewSic runs on a custom fine-tuned OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model, providing more accurate and personalized Bollywood-style content.
- For now I am hosting the backend using a Flask server, as making the API call using just the JS directly to openAI had the chance of my API getting exhausted(and I did have to beg someone for the credit card.. so that would not be ideal)

## Installation

1. Download the extension files or clone the repository.

2. Open your Chrome browser and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
